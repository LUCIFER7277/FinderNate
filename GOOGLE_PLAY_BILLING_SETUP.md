# Google Play Billing — setup

What has to exist outside the codebase before an in-app subscription can be
bought. The code is done; everything below is console work.

Play app: **Findernate**, package `com.findernate.app`, app ID
`4972555896537488250`, under developer account **Findernate Ecom Private
Limited** (`7987434650123861211`).

---

## Why the order matters

These steps genuinely cannot be reordered:

1. **A build containing the billing library must be uploaded first.** Until an
   AAB with the Play Billing Library reaches a track, Play Console's
   Subscriptions page just says *"Upload a new APK"* and will not let you create
   a product. That build exists now — `in_app_purchase` pulls the library in.
2. **A payments profile must exist before products can be priced.**
3. **Products must exist before the app can query them** — otherwise
   `queryProductDetails` returns them in `notFoundIDs` and the plans screen
   shows no Play prices.
4. **The service account must be linked before the server can verify anything.**

---

## 1. Payments profile  *(only the account owner can do this)*

Play Console → **Monetise with Play** → **Get started**.

Needs Findernate Ecom Private Limited's legal details, tax info (PAN/GST) and a
bank account. Nothing can be sold until this is complete and verified, which
can take a few days.

## 2. Upload the AAB to Internal testing

Play Console → **Test and release** → **Testing** → **Internal testing** →
**Create new release**, and upload
`build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.

Add yourself to the tester list. This is also the first build on which the
Cashfree store flow can be tested properly — Cashfree's production SDK rejects
sideloaded installs, which is why it never worked from a local APK.

## 3. Create the subscription products

Play Console → **Monetise with Play** → **Products** → **Subscriptions**.

Create two, with product IDs matching `PLAY_PRODUCT_TO_PLAN` in
`src/controllers/subscription/plans.js` exactly — **product IDs are permanent**:

| Product ID       | Name           | Base plan ID | Billing period | Price      |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| `small_business` | Small Business | `monthly`    | Monthly        | see below  |
| `corporate`      | Corporate      | `monthly`    | Monthly        | ₹2999      |

Set each base plan to **auto-renewing** and activate it — a base plan left as a
draft is invisible to the app.

> ⚠️ **Small Business is ₹1/month in `plans.js`.** That is a test value. Decide
> the real price before creating the product; Play makes price changes for
> existing subscribers slow and consent-gated.

Note the backend's `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS` prices are now only used for display and
for the Cashfree (web) path. On Android, Play's price is authoritative and is
what the user is actually charged — the plans screen shows Play's localised
string, not ours.

## 4. Service account for the Developer API

The server has to ask Google what a purchase token means. That needs a Google
Cloud service account with access to the Play developer account.

1. **Google Cloud Console** → pick or create a project → **APIs & Services** →
   enable **Google Play Android Developer API**.
2. **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts** → create one, e.g.
   `findernate-play-billing`. No project roles are required.
3. On that service account → **Keys** → **Add key** → **JSON**. Download it.
   *This file is a credential — it must not go into the repo.*
4. **Play Console → Setup → API access** → link the Google Cloud project from
   step 1, find the service account, **Grant access**, and give it:
   - View financial data, orders, and cancellation survey responses
   - Manage orders and subscriptions

   Restrict it to the Findernate app rather than the whole account.

> The linkage in step 4 is the one people miss. Without it every call fails with
> *"The current user has insufficient permissions"*, which reads like an OAuth
> scope problem and is not — the scope is fine, the service account simply is
> not known to the Play account.

> Access can take up to 24 hours to propagate. A 401 immediately after granting
> is usually just that.

## 5. Real-time Developer Notifications

Without this, renewals never reach us: Play charges the card by itself and only
announces it here. A subscriber's `endDate` would lapse a month after purchase.

1. **Google Cloud → Pub/Sub → Topics** → create e.g. `play-rtdn`.
2. Grant `google-play-developer-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com` the
   **Pub/Sub Publisher** role on that topic. (Play cannot publish without it.)
3. **Play Console → Monetise with Play → Monetisation setup** → paste the full
   topic name, then **Send test notification** to confirm.
4. Back in Pub/Sub, create a **push** subscription on the topic with endpoint:

   ```
   https://api.findernate.com/api/v1/subscription/google-play/notification?token=<GOOGLE_PLAY_RTDN_SECRET>
   ```

   The `?token=` shared secret is the only authentication on that route — it is
   public because Pub/Sub has no user session. Generate something long and
   random and keep it out of the repo.

## 6. Licence testers (test purchases without being charged)

Play Console → **Setup → Licence testing** → add the Google accounts that should
get test purchases. Their purchases are free and renew on an accelerated clock
(a monthly subscription renews every ~5 minutes), which is the only practical
way to exercise the renewal and RTDN paths.

Testers must also be on the Internal testing track and must install the app
**from Play**, not by sideloading.

## Environment variables

Add to the backend environment (and to whatever secret store production uses):

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | yes* | The service-account JSON from step 3. Raw JSON, or base64 of it — base64 is safer in `.env` files, which mangle the newlines inside `private_key`. |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` | yes* | Alternative to the above: a path to the JSON on disk. |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_PACKAGE_NAME` | no | Defaults to `com.findernate.app`. |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_RTDN_SECRET` | yes | Shared secret in the Pub/Sub push URL. Without it the notification route rejects everything with 403. |

\* one of the two.

To base64 the key file:

```bash
base64 -w0 findernate-play-billing.json
```

## What the code does

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Play API client (lookup + acknowledge) | `src/config/googlePlay.config.js` |
| Verify endpoint + RTDN handler + reconcile | `src/controllers/subscription/googlePlay.js` |
| Activation logic shared with Cashfree | `src/controllers/subscription/activation.js` |
| Product ID ↔ plan tier map | `src/controllers/subscription/plans.js` |
| Routes | `src/routes/subscription.routes.js` |
| App-side billing | `lib/services/google_play_billing.dart` (Flutter repo) |

Endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/subscription/google-play/verify` — authenticated, takes
  `{ purchaseToken }` only. The plan, price and buyer all come from Google's
  answer, never from the request body.
- `POST /api/v1/subscription/google-play/notification` — public, Pub/Sub push,
  authenticated by `?token=`.

Cashfree is untouched and still handles the website's subscriptions and the
physical-goods store on every platform. Play Billing is not permitted for
physical goods, so the store must stay on Cashfree.

## Testing checklist

- [ ] Test notification from Monetisation setup arrives (look for
      `[Play RTDN] Test notification received`)
- [ ] Plans screen shows Play's localised prices, not the backend's
- [ ] Buying as a licence tester activates the plan and grants calling
- [ ] Killing the app between paying and verifying still activates on next
      launch (this is the `restorePurchases()` path)
- [ ] Verifying the same token twice succeeds rather than erroring
- [ ] A renewal (~5 min on a test account) extends `endDate` via RTDN
- [ ] Cancelling keeps access until `endDate`, then revokes it
- [ ] A non-business account is refused *before* Play's payment sheet opens
