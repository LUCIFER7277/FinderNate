// Google Play Developer API — subscription purchase lookup + acknowledgement.
//
// Called with a purchase token from the app. Everything we then trust about a
// purchase (which product, whether it is actually paid, when it expires, whose
// account it belongs to) comes from THIS lookup and never from the client, the
// same rule the Cashfree path follows.
//
// Auth is a Google Cloud service account that has been granted access in Play
// Console under Users and permissions, with the "View financial data" and
// "Manage orders and subscriptions" permissions. The service account also has
// to be linked to the Play developer account via the Google Cloud project bound
// in Play Console > Setup > API access; without that link every call 401s with
// "The current user has insufficient permissions", which reads like a scope
// problem but is not.
//
// Talking to the REST endpoint directly through axios rather than pulling in
// `googleapis`: that package ships every Google API surface and is enormous,
// and we need exactly two calls.
