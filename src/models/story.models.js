// Stories are purged 24 hours after they are posted — the row AND the media
// file — by the story-expiry job (src/jobs/storyExpiry.job.js). NOT by a
// MongoDB TTL index.
//
// A TTL index (expiresAt, expireAfterSeconds: 0) used to live here and was
// removed deliberately. The TTL monitor drops the document and knows nothing
// about Bunny: every expiry left the image or video live on the CDN forever,
// so the row vanished but the storage bill did not — deletion that is only
// cosmetic. The job does it in the safe order instead, media first and the row
// only once that succeeded, so a Bunny failure leaves the row for the next
// pass rather than orphaning the file.
//
// DEPLOY NOTE: the old TTL index still exists on the live collection and
// Mongoose will not alter an existing index's expireAfterSeconds. It has to be
// dropped by hand — db.stories.dropIndex('expiresAt_1') — otherwise Mongo keeps
// racing the job and orphaning media exactly as before.
//
// Archived stories stay exempt, as they were under the TTL's partial filter:
// fetchArchivedStoriesByUser reads { userId, isArchived: true } long after
// expiresAt has gone by, so the job only ever considers isArchived: false.

// Serves the purge job's scan ({ isArchived: false, expiresAt <= now, not
// currently claimed }) and, on its { isArchived, expiresAt } prefix, the
// stories tray (fetchStoriesFeed) and the profile stories tab, which both
// filter { isArchived: false, expiresAt: { $gt: now } }.
