/**
 * Send a transactional email.
 *
 * Returns a RESULT rather than throwing. Every caller (password-reset OTP,
 * email-change OTP, notifications, the guest-checkout claim link) sits on a
 * path where a bounced email must not take the whole operation down with it —
 * a failed claim email may not fail a payment that has already settled. But
 * the previous version swallowed the error and returned `undefined`, so those
 * callers reported success unconditionally and a silently dead mailbox was
 * indistinguishable from a delivered message. Check `success`.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{success: boolean, messageId?: string, error?: string}>}

// Host and port are configurable, with Zoho's SMTP as the default because that
// is what this deployment uses. They were previously hardcoded while .env
// carried EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT that nothing read — so changing either had
// no effect and cost real debugging time.
//
// Port drives the transport mode and the two must agree: 465 is implicit TLS
// (secure: true), 587 is STARTTLS (secure: false). Deriving `secure` from the
// port rather than taking it as a third setting removes the combination that
// silently fails to connect.

// holds `EMAIL_HOST=FindeNate` — a (misspelled) display name someone put in a
// hostname slot. That was harmless while the host was hardcoded, but the moment
// this file started honouring the variable it would have pointed every SMTP
// connection at a name that does not resolve, breaking password resets, OTPs and
// the guest-checkout claim link platform-wide. A value with no dot in it cannot
// be a public mail host, so it is rejected in favour of the working default and
// reported loudly rather than obeyed silently.
