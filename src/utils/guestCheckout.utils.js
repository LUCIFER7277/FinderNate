// GUEST CHECKOUT — shared by BOTH public checkouts
//
//   • shareable payment links   POST /payments/post/create-order
//                               (payments.controllers.js)
//   • the online store          POST /payments/store/create-order
//                               (cashfree.payment.controller.js)
//
// A guest can create an order without an account. The account is created only
// once the payment is CONFIRMED, so an abandoned checkout leaves no orphan
// identity, and it is NEVER created for an email that already belongs to
// someone — that would be an account takeover by typed email address.
//
// Nothing on this path issues a session token. The buyer reaches the new
// account through the existing public reset-OTP pair
// (/users/send-reset-otp + /users/reset-password).
//
// WHY THIS IS A SHARED MODULE AND NOT A COPY IN EACH CONTROLLER.
// The two checkouts settle in different files, and for a long time only the
// shareable one back-filled a buyer: a store guest paid, the order settled to
// paymentStatus 'paid' with buyerId:null, and it stayed ownerless forever — no
// order history, no confirm-delivery, no dispute, no invoice, while the money
// sat in escrow. The fix is the SAME pipeline in both places, which only stays
// true if there is exactly one implementation of it. Account creation and the
// auto-refund in particular must never exist twice: two copies of "who owns
// this money" is how one of them silently stops matching reality.
//
// Everything here is written to be called from a payment confirmation. Nothing
// throws into one (the validators at the top are the exception — they run at
// order creation, before any money has moved).

// registers in another tab, or a sibling guest checkout for the same address
// settles first. It is rare, and the handling here is deliberately small.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO "CLAIM YOUR ORDER" ENDPOINT ANY MORE.
// The previous pass parked these orders at guestClaim.status =
// 'claimable_existing_account' and shipped POST /orders/:orderId/claim, which
// attached the order to whichever signed-in account's `email` field matched.
// That endpoint WAS the takeover it was written to prevent: registration in this
// codebase verifies the PHONE only — auth.js verifyRegistrationOTP sets
// isPhoneVerified:true and never touches isEmailVerified, which stays at its
// schema default of false — so `user.email` is an UNPROVEN string. Anyone who
// learned the email on a guest order could register that address against their
// own phone, claim the paid order, confirm delivery, and have the escrow
// released for goods that were never shipped, with the real buyer locked out
// permanently. Requiring isEmailVerified === true would not have saved it
// either: that flag is false for essentially every account on the platform,
// including the ones guest checkout itself creates, so the endpoint would have
// been dead code still carrying the risk.
//
// So the money goes back instead. Cashfree refunds are already wired up and
// proven on the admin path (adminEscrow.controllers.js manualRefundPayment uses
// createCashfreeRefund), so an automated refund is genuinely available here —
// no human needed for the common case, and nothing ownerless is ever left

/**
 * The whole settlement pipeline for ONE confirmed guest order, in the one order
 * these steps are correct in:
 *
 *   1. back-fill the buyer  — BEFORE the escrow entry, so the ledger row records
 *      the buyer instead of null (it copies order.buyerId at write time).
 *   2. write the escrow entry — the caller does this, in `writeEscrowEntry`,
 *      because the two flows record it differently (hold vs credit).
 *   3. auto-refund a collision — AFTER the escrow entry, because the refund
 *      unwinds the very entry step 2 wrote.
 *
 * Getting that order wrong is silent: refunding first debits a balance that
 * does not exist yet and then re-holds money that has already gone back. Both
 * flows call this rather than each open-coding the sequence.
 *
 * Returns { orphaned } — true only for the single execution that queued the
 * refund, so a racing sibling does not fire a second (harmless) attempt.
 *
 * This is the ONLY entry point: backfillGuestBuyer and refundOrphanedGuestOrder
 * are deliberately module-private, because calling either alone is a bug that
 * looks like working code.
