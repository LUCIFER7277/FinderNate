/**
 * One place that turns "this user should be told about X" into an actual push.
 *
 * Before this existed the only event that ever reached FCM was a chat message
 * (chat/message.controllers.js) and a call (call.controllers.js). Everything
 * else — follows, contact requests, business verification — was written to the
 * Notification collection and emitted on the Socket.IO `notification` channel
 * and nothing more. The mobile client turns that socket event into a LOCAL
 * notification, which means it can only ever fire while the app is running and
 * connected. That is exactly the reported symptom "push notifications only
 * arrive after the app has been opened once": for those events there was no
 * push at all, only an in-process socket message.
 *
 * Two delivery paths, because the two clients register differently:
 *   - FCM, keyed on User.fcmToken, is the MOBILE app.
 *   - web-push/VAPID, keyed on the PushSubscription collection, is the WEBSITE.
 * A user can legitimately have both; neither is a substitute for the other.

/**
 * Android notification channels the mobile app creates at startup
 * (NotificationServices._createNotificationChannels in the Flutter app).
 *
 * Getting this right is not cosmetic. The "calls" channel is configured with a
 * ringtone (RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('call_ringtone')) and high
 * importance, so routing a follow or a contact request onto it would make the
 * device ring as if someone were calling. Anything that is not a message and
 * not a call belongs on a normal-importance social channel.

 * must not disturb.
 *
 * The message carries a top-level `notification` block on purpose. A DATA-ONLY
 * FCM message is handed to the app's background handler and is only displayed
 * if that handler runs — on a killed app, on OEM builds that aggressively stop
 * background isolates (Xiaomi/Oppo/Vivo/Samsung), it frequently never runs and
 * the user sees nothing. With a `notification` block the OS itself posts the
 * tray notification whether or not any Dart code executes, and `data` still
 * rides along for the tap handler.
