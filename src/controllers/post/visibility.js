/**
 * "May this viewer touch this post at all?"
 *
 * getPostById enforces the whole chain — block in either direction, the
 * author's account privacy, the post's own privacy flag — but every OTHER
 * endpoint hanging off the same post (comments, likes, saves) enforced
 * nothing, so asking for a post's comments or liking it was a way around the
 * gate the post read path defends.
 *
 * checkContentVisibility is the platform's existing gate and already covers
 * blocking (both directions), deactivated/banned/deleted authors, and account
 * privacy including the isFullPrivate flag. The only thing it does not know
 * about is the POST-level privacy flag, which is a separate field, so that is
 * checked here on top.
 *
 * 404 rather than 403 for a block or a hidden account: whether a given post
 * exists is itself information the blocked party should not get, and it is how
 * getPostById answers the same situation.
 *
 * @param {string} postId
 * @param {string|import('mongoose').Types.ObjectId|null} viewerId  null for anonymous callers
 * @param {{ notFoundMessage?: string }} [options]
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} the post document ({ _id, userId, settings.privacy })
