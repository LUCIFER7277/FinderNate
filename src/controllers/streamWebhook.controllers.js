/**
 * Bunny Stream encoding webhook.
 *
 * Upload returns a GUID and a playable-looking URL immediately, but the
 * renditions take roughly 10-30s for a short clip. Media is written with
 * `processing: true` and this clears it, so the feeds can show the thumbnail
 * rather than a player that fails.
 *
 * Bunny POSTs { VideoLibraryId, VideoGuid, Status }. The statuses that matter:
 *   4 = Finished        -> playable, clear the flag
 *   5 = Error
 *   6 = UploadFailed    -> it will never play; clear it anyway so the client
 *                          stops waiting and shows its normal error state
 *                          instead of a spinner that never resolves.
 *
 * Bunny does not sign these, so the payload is treated as untrusted: the only
 * thing acted on is "a video with this GUID finished", and the GUID has to
 * already be stored against a post. An attacker who guesses one can at worst
 * clear a flag that was about to clear itself.
