    // THIS IS THE FIX FOR ORDERS THAT USED TO SETTLE OWNERLESS. The store flow
    // creates guest orders with buyerId:null and used to stop right after the
    // escrow credit: no account, no marker, nothing flagged. The buyer ended up
    // with no order history, no way to confirm delivery, no way to dispute and
    // no invoice, while their money sat in escrow indefinitely.

    // back-fill runs BEFORE the escrow write (the ledger row copies
    // order.buyerId at write time, so crediting first stamps the row with null)
    // and the refund runs AFTER it (it unwinds the entry the credit just made).
    // Identical sequence to the shareable flow, from the same module — the only
    // difference is that this flow records a credit where that one records a
    // hold. Idempotent in every ordering: account creation and the claim
    // message are both gated on winning one atomic conditional update.
