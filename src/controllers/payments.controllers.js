// server-computed, so it was never a payment bypass, but it was a standing
// revenue leak for every product priced at ₹499 or more.
//
// So the caller now says which flow it is, and the amount is validated against
// THAT flow's own total:
//   PRICING_FLOW.SHAREABLE_LINK — createShareablePhonePeOrder. Charges the full
//       total including shipping. This is the money path for this file.
//   PRICING_FLOW.ONLINE_STORE   — the store's own total (shipping waived at
//       ≥ ₹499). The store checkout itself lives in

//       constant exists so anything in this file that has to speak for that
//       flow validates against the right number.

// is accepted only where a link minted by the store actually exists at exactly

    //     charge, and is rejected on mismatch exactly as everywhere else — the
