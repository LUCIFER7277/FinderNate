/**
 * Story Expiry Cron Job
 * Runs every 15 minutes and removes stories that are more than 24 hours old.
 *
 * A story has to be gone 24 hours after it was posted — the database row AND
 * the media file behind it. A Mongo TTL index only does the first half: it
 * drops the document and leaves the image or video sitting in the Bunny
 * storage zone (or the Stream library) forever, still billable and still
 * reachable by anyone who kept the URL. That is why the TTL index was taken
 * off story.models.js and replaced by this job.
 *
 * Order matters: media first, row second. If Bunny fails we keep the row, log
 * it, and let a later pass try again — a row is recoverable, an orphaned file
 * nobody has a reference to is not.
 *
 * Safe to run on several instances at once: each row is claimed atomically
 * with findOneAndUpdate before its media is touched, so no file is deleted
 * twice and no two workers race on the same story. Claims older than
 * CLAIM_TTL_MS are treated as abandoned (a worker that died mid-pass, or a
 * media delete that failed) and are picked up again.
